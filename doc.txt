Recently I was contacted by a friend asking for assistance with driving an RGB LED strip with an Arduino, and I thought this might be a great project for myself as I have been using an RGB LED strip inside my PC case for quite some time. Unfortunately, I was using the default remote control and microcontroller provided with the strip, which didn't give me a whole lot of flexibility.

Part 1: Hardware

The most crucial step in this project was wiring up the Arduino with some NMOSFETs to drive the LED strip since it uses 12V logic. Here are the parts I used:

	- 5M RGB LED 
	- Arduino Nano (ATmega328P) x 1
	- IRLB8721 N-Channel MOSFET x 3
	- Mini-USB Type B to USB Type A Cable x 1
	- Internal USB Header to USB Type A x 1 (Optional)
	- Breadboard x 1
	- Assorted Colors/Lengths of Jumper Wires x ???

Wiring is pretty simple and straightforward.
